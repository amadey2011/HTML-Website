        <p>Soccer is a game that is played around the world. First, there are different teams that go against each other. The basic positions in soccer, is the defender, goalie, attacker, and midfielder. You play with a round ball and try to score on the opposing goal. But, you have to make sure not to score on your own goal, otherwise, you're giving the other team a free point. Now that we know that, we can go over the positions and what each position is helpful for. The first position is the goalie. The goalie tries to block the ball from going into the goal, and he can use his hands to block the goal, not just his feet. Next, the defender helps the goalie, but cannot use their hands like the goalie. Instead, they try to steal the ball from the player to make it easier for the goalie. Third, there is the midfielder. The midfielder stays at the middle of the field, and tries to pass or steal the ball from other players. They also sometimes try to score  by dribbling the ball with them. The last position is the attacker. The attacker can be anywheere on the field, but is mainly towards the top of the field, more on the oponents side of the field. They try to mainly steal the ball from people near the goal and score. However, they sometimes pass to other teammates.</p>
